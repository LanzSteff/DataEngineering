%Task IV: Modeling
\chapter{Modeling}
For our model with the prepared data we used the tool WEKA to perform the classification algorithm Logistic Regression with cross validation, which is a class for building and using a multinomial logistic regression model with a ridge estimator. The probability is calculated as follows:
$$\frac{1}{1 + \sum_{j=1}^{k-1} e^{X_i \cdot B_j}}$$
